          "text": "We stayed at Dallas NE Campground (also called Dallas Northeast Campground & RV Park) in Caddo Mills, TX and overall had a pretty good experience. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and the place was clean with well-maintained gravel roads and some concrete pads. We liked that they had a pool, a pond for fishing, a small store, and a playground—definitely family-friendly. It’s in a convenient spot, about 20 minutes from shopping and restaurants, and just 5 minutes to a local market. It’s also right off I-30, which makes it a super easy on/off stop for anyone passing through—really convenient for travelers. That said, being close to the highway does mean some road noise. A few areas could use a little more upkeep, and the bathrooms were a bit dated but were clean and worked well. WiFi was okay, not amazing. Great view of the sky though if you use Starlink. There’s a mix of short-term visitors and permanent residents, which didn’t bother us but worth mentioning. Overall, a decent spot if you’re looking for something laid-back, kid-friendly, and easy to get to near Dallas.",
