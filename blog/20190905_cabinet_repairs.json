  "intro": "If you happen to own a Grand Design Imagine with the dark cabinetry, you may have noticed color fading anywhere water tends to drip. We ran into the same issue — but found a super simple fix you can store right inside your RV.",

      "paragraphs": [
        "Pretty much anywhere that water has a chance to drip, the cabinet finish tends to fade or lose color. This is especially noticeable around sinks, bathrooms, and under the kitchen counter.",
        "Ours started developing these light, worn-looking spots that made the cabinetry look older than it really was."

        "We found a simple solution that’s inexpensive, easy to store in the RV, and quick to apply — the **Minwax Stain Marker in Ebony**.",
        "It goes on smoothly and blends right into the dark cabinetry finish. Honestly, it’s so easy to use that even a kid could do it!"

    {
      "heading": "The Results",
      "paragraphs": [
        "After applying the stain marker, the faded spots blended right in and the cabinets looked so much better. It took just a few minutes, dried quickly, and made a noticeable difference.",
        "Minwax also makes a clear coat pen, which might be worth adding afterward to seal in the color and help prevent future fading."
