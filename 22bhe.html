        <h2>Why We Chose the 22BHE</h2>
        <p>
            We picked the <strong>Grand Design Imagine XLS 22BHE</strong> after a lot of searching, comparing,
            and crawling through trailers—and now that we’re two years into ownership, we can honestly say it’s
            everything we hoped it would be.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted a couple’s trailer that was <strong>half-ton towable</strong> but also still had space for
            our adult kids to come along, space for our mid-sized dog, a cat if we want, and room for us to work
            remotely. The ability to reach the <strong>fridge and bathroom with the slides in</strong> was a must-have
            as well. The 22BHE meets every one of those needs without feeling cramped or compromised.
        </p>

        <h2>Comfort & Layout</h2>
        <p>
            One of the things we appreciate most is the <strong>headroom</strong>. At 5'10" and 6'3", it’s such a relief
            not to duck through doorways or squeeze into a tiny shower—because we actually fit in this one. The layout
            feels open and comfortable, and the <strong>kitchen counter space and cabinet storage</strong> is genuinely
            impressive for a trailer this size.
        </p>

        <h2>Construction & Build Quality</h2>
        <p>
            After looking at plenty of other RVs, the construction on Grand Design really stands out. You can really tell
            Grand Design didn’t cut corners. The <strong>laminated aluminum framed walls</strong> give the trailer a
            solid, well-built feel. The <strong>wood truss roof</strong> is another detail we love; it feels sturdy,
            quiet, and holds temperature well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>one-piece TPO roof</strong>, the <strong>fully enclosed heated underbelly</strong>, and the
            <strong>heavy-duty NitroFill tires</strong> give us so much peace of mind, whether we’re camping in cold
            weather or towing long distances. Even the <strong>aluminum entry steps</strong> feel like an upgrade—no
            rust, no binding, and they’re just nicer to use. We really appreciate the <strong>ductless flooring</strong>,
            which keeps dirt out of the vents (huge win when you travel with a dog!).
        </p>

        <h2>Comfort in All Seasons</h2>
        <p>
            One of the big selling points for us was the <strong>4-Seasons Protection Package</strong>, and it’s lived up
            to the hype. The trailer stays comfortable in all kinds of weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re not sold on the <strong>tankless water heater</strong>—we miss the convenience of being able to run the
            water pump off electric—but it does heat that water up quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>double axle</strong> and <strong>integrated anti-lock brakes</strong> make towing feel safer.
        </p>

        <h2>Solar, Power & the 12V Fridge</h2>
        <p>
            We like the idea of camping in more remote locations, so the <strong>factory solar setup</strong> was a huge
            selling point, plus the option to add more solar at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the <strong>BEST</strong> things has been the <strong>12 volt fridge</strong> that runs off the solar
            panel (or battery)—this means we can have the fridge on while we are traveling down the road <em>and</em>
            the internal components are smaller, leaving more usable space inside the fridge and freezer (what a win-win)!
        </p>

        <h2>Storage & Exterior Features</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>pass-through storage</strong> is also incredible—a huge compartment that we can actually fully
            use because Grand Design cuts the door opening larger than other trailers and routes plumbing and wiring out
            of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>accessory hitch</strong> gives us room for extra gear on longer trips.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            If you watch the walkthrough video, this write-up should give you a better idea of why we chose this model
            and why we’re so happy with it. If you’re considering the 22BHE, hopefully our experience helps you decide
            if it’s the right fit for you, too.
