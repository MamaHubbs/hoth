        <h2>Why We Chose the 22BHE</h2>
        <p>
            We picked the <strong>Grand Design Imagine XLS 22BHE</strong> after a lot of searching, comparing, 
            and crawling through trailers—and now that we’re two years into ownership, we can honestly say it’s 
            everything we hoped it would be.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted a couple’s trailer that was <strong>half-ton towable</strong> but also still had space for 
            our adult kids, our mid-sized dog, a cat if we want, and enough room to work remotely. Being able to 
            reach the <strong>fridge and bathroom with the slide in</strong> was a must-have. The 22BHE checks all 
            of those boxes without feeling cramped.
        </p>

        <h2>Comfort & Layout</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best parts is the <strong>headroom</strong>. At 5'10" and 6'3", we don’t have to duck through 
            doorways or squeeze into a tiny shower. The layout feels open, and the 
            <strong>kitchen counter space and cabinets</strong> are surprisingly generous for a trailer this size.
        </p>

        <h2>Construction & Build Quality</h2>
        <p>
            After looking at many other RVs, the construction on Grand Design stood out. The 
            <strong>laminated aluminum framed walls</strong> give the trailer a solid feel, and the 
            <strong>wood truss roof</strong> is sturdy, quiet, and holds temperature well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>one-piece TPO roof</strong>, fully enclosed heated underbelly, and 
            <strong>NitroFill tires</strong> give peace of mind in cold weather and long towing days. 
            Even the <strong>aluminum entry steps</strong> feel like a real upgrade.  
            The <strong>ductless flooring</strong> is huge for keeping dirt and dog hair out of vents.
        </p>

        <h2>Comfort in All Seasons</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>4-Seasons Protection Package</strong> really works—this trailer stays comfortable in 
            all sorts of weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re lukewarm on the <strong>tankless water heater</strong> (we miss being able to run the pump 
            off electric), but it heats water fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>double axle</strong> and <strong>integrated anti-lock brakes</strong> make towing feel 
            stable and controlled.
        </p>

        <h2>Solar Power & the 12V Fridge</h2>
        <p>
            We love camping off-grid, so the <strong>factory solar setup</strong> was a big selling point.  
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the biggest wins is the <strong>12V refrigerator</strong>. It runs off solar or battery, stays 
            on while traveling, and has more usable interior space because the components are smaller. 
            Huge win-win.
        </p>

        <h2>Storage & Exterior Features</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>pass-through storage</strong> is fantastic. Grand Design cuts the openings larger than 
            most trailers and routes wiring out of the way so the whole space is usable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>accessory hitch</strong> also gives us easy space for extra gear.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re watching our walkthrough video, we hope this write-up helps explain why we chose the 22BHE 
            and why we’re still so happy with it two years later.
